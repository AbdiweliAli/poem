Turvy-Topsy

‘Gentlemen and Ladies, all and one,

Let’s have a little games and fun.



I’ve noticed that the things we say,

Sound wrong if said a different way.



I’ve never wandered forth and back,

Never been beaten blue and black.



And through my life, large and by,

I’ve yet to be left dry and high.



Error and trial, punishment and crime,

It’s go and touch, again and time.



My fortunes are not down and up.

I never drink from a saucer and cup.
